## Pop Transition

Simple app to assist with migrating packages from Debian to Flatpak

This app notifies users when a debian package they have installed is no longer
maintained in the Pop!_OS repositories, and offers to install Flatpak versions
instead. This will ensure that these apps are correctly updated in the future.

This Application is unavailable for Pop_OS 18.04 (Bionic Beaver). Please upgrade 
to a more recent version to transition your applications from Apt to Flatpak.
